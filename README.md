Developing a Custom GUI Layer for Your UNO Game
Objective
Building upon your previous console-based UNO game project, this assignment challenges
you to develop your own custom GUI framework layer above Java Swing, and then implement
a graphical version of your UNO game using only components from your custom layer.
This project will enhance your understanding of GUI programming principles, abstraction,
component design, and layout management.
